Various tests (in C++) language.

1. TestLog -- How long does it take to compute a log?
2. TestExp -- How long does it take to compute an exponent?
3. TestPow -- 
    i) How long does it take to exponentiate? 
    ii) What if an exponent is an integer?
    iii) Can we improve by using a hand-crafted function? 
4. TestTrigon -- How long does it take to compute basic trigonometric functions?
